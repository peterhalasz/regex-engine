# regex-engine
An implementation of a regular expression engine.

# Why
To help me with learning about formal automata.
This implementation follows a strict by-the-book approach.
The regular expression gets converted to an Îµ-NFA, that can be converted to an NFA, which gets
converted to a DFA, that can actually run the matching.

# How

# TODOs
[] Refactor NFA-DFA algorithm
[] Add more integration tests
[] Add comments / docs
[] Fix start and final state in the printer
